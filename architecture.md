# SAP CAP Digital Assistant Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for the SAP CAP digital assistant application, designed to answer user queries in natural language using SAP AI services and provide an intuitive frontend using SAP UI5/Fiori.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Node.js Backend
- **Purpose:** Serve as the backend framework to build the CAP application.
- **Integration:** Connects with SAP AI services to process user queries.

### 2. SAP AI Services
- **Purpose:** Provide natural language processing capabilities.
- **Integration:** Integrated via RESTful APIs to the CAP application for processing user queries.

### 3. SAP UI5/Fiori Frontend
- **Purpose:** Deliver an intuitive user interface similar to popular chat platforms.
- **Integration:** Interfaces with the Node.js backend to display AI-generated responses.

### 4. xsuaa for Authentication
- **Purpose:** Secure the application using SAP's identity authentication services.
- **Integration:** Configured to authenticate users accessing the application.

### 5. Multi-Target Application (MTA)
- **Purpose:** Facilitate deployment across SAP Cloud Platform.
- **Integration:** Bundles the application components for deployment.

### 6. App Router
- **Purpose:** Route requests from the frontend to the appropriate backend services.
- **Integration:** Manages routes between SAP UI5/Fiori frontend and Node.js backend.

### 7. SAP Hana
- **Purpose:** Serve as the primary database for storing user data and interactions.
- **Integration:** Stores and retrieves data processed by the CAP application.

### 8. SAP AI Core (Optional for Gen AI)
- **Purpose:** Utilize advanced AI capabilities for more complex queries.
- **Integration:** Enhances the AI processing capabilities of the digital assistant.

### 9. SAP Cloud Foundry
- **Purpose:** Host the application in a scalable cloud environment.
- **Integration:** Deploys the application components securely and efficiently.

### 10. WebdriverIO for Testing
- **Purpose:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the application.
- **Integration:** Ensures the application meets performance and usability standards.
